# Vanilla TypeScript Project

This project is created for learning the basics and more advanced concepts of TypeScript without using any frameworks. Here you will find code examples and exercises to dive into the world of TypeScript.

This will run the TypeScript Compiler (tsc) and compile TypeScript files into the `dist` directory, then start a local server for viewing.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: This directory contains TypeScript source files.
  - **index.ts**: Main application file.
  - **advanced/**: Directory for more advanced examples and concepts.
- **dist/**: Compiled JavaScript files are stored here.
- **public/**: Public project files (HTML, CSS, etc.).

## Exercises

In the `src/advanced` directory, you'll find exercises for a deeper understanding of TypeScript. Try to complete them, exploring both basic and advanced language features.

## Resources

For more information or if you have questions, refer to the official TypeScript documentation: [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

This README contains basic project information, installation and running instructions, a guide to completing exercises, and links to additional resources. You can add your own sections or information as needed.
